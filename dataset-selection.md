Choosing the **Kartik2112 (Credit Card)** dataset alongside your primary data is a strategic move to ensure your project is reliable, professional, and high-scoring.

Here is the justification for this choice:

### **1. Proving the System Works Everywhere**

* **Different Money Types:** Your first dataset focuses on mobile phone payments, while this second one focuses on credit cards.
* **Broad Accuracy:** Using both shows that your fraud detector isn't just good at one specific thing; it can catch criminals across different types of banking systems.
* **Reliability:** It’s like testing a security camera in both daylight and at night—it proves the tool is reliable in any situation.

### **2. Meeting the "Extra Effort" Rules for a Higher Grade**

* **Exceeding Requirements:** The project rules give more points to students who use "additional datasets" to show they did extra work.
* **Showing Skill:** Handling two different types of data proves you have the skills to organize and clean complex information, which is a key requirement for a top grade.

### **3. Catching "New" and "Strange" Patterns**

* **Hidden Fraud:** Sometimes fraud doesn't look like a typical "theft." This second dataset helps the system learn how to spot "weird" behavior that doesn't fit the usual patterns.
* **Better Safety:** By learning from two different sources, the system becomes much harder for fraudsters to trick.

### **4. Adding Better Features to the Final App**

* **Location Tracking:** This new dataset includes information about *where* a transaction happened (like city or state), which your first dataset lacks.
* **Interactive Maps:** Because of this extra data, you can build a map in your final website to show "Fraud Hotspots," making the app look much more professional and "highly refined".
